# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used & Use Cases
I used **GitHub Copilot** and **ChatGPT** to assist with this assignment.

* **GitHub Copilot:** I primarily used Copilot for code completion and to generate small functions within the `script.js` file. For instance, it helped in quickly writing the smooth scrolling function and the alert for the contact form submission.

* **ChatGPT:** I used ChatGPT for higher-level tasks, such as getting ideas for the overall website structure and design based on a reference image. It also helped generate the initial boilerplate HTML and the content for the project descriptions and "About Me" section.

## Benefits & Challenges
**Benefits:** Using AI tools significantly sped up the development process. Instead of building every line of code from scratch, I could focus on the overall structure and content. This helped me meet the assignment requirements efficiently.

**Challenges:** The main challenge was ensuring the AI-generated code was clean, consistent, and fully understood. I had to manually review and refine the code to fix inconsistencies and ensure it was correctly formatted and well-commented. It also required a good understanding of the underlying principles to make informed decisions about the code.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this process, I learned that AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for fundamental coding knowledge. It's a great tool for speeding up the initial setup and providing solutions to specific problems, but a developer must understand how the code works to debug, customize, and integrate it responsibly.

## How I Modified AI Suggestions
The AI suggestions served as a starting point. For the CSS, I completely rewrote the styles to match the specific design and color palette of the reference image. For the project descriptions, I edited the text to be more personal and specific to my background in cybersecurity and networking.
