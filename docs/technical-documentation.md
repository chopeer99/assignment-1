# Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills and projects in computer science, with a focus on cybersecurity and networking. The site is a static web application composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be responsive across different devices.

## Technology Stack
* **HTML5:** Used for the semantic structure of the website.
* **CSS3:** Used for all styling, including layout, colors, typography, and responsive design features. The site uses CSS Flexbox and Grid to manage the layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Used for adding basic interactivity, such as smooth scrolling for navigation links.

## Design and Architecture
The website follows a clear, single-page application structure with distinct sections for different content. The design is based on a modern, dark theme with a vibrant accent color to improve readability and visual appeal.

* **Header:** Contains the navigation links and a custom-styled logo.
* **Hero/About Section:** A prominent, centered section to introduce myself, inspired by a professional developer's website.
* **Skills Section:** A two-column layout to display my technical skills and experience.
* **Projects Section:** A grid-based layout to showcase two key projects with brief descriptions.
* **Contact Form:** A simple form for user communication, handled by a JavaScript alert without a backend.

## Responsive Design
The website's layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries. This ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.
